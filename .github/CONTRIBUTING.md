# Contributing Guide

- `src` folder is used to hold languages files, each language folder should be named like `en-us`
- Use [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) Lang to maintain this project
- Principle:
  1. Each file should be a single module or a specific filed (like `nofly`)
  2. Each translation should occur only once (like `org: 组织`)
  3. Oral common words/sentences should be all placed in `common`
